# Project-Management
Java Spring project. 

This a project that I did for my Java Spring Framework course. Made with Java Spring, Hibernate, Entity Relationships, postgreSQL, Spring JPA, Security, REST, Lombok, Thymleaf, Bootstrap and other dependencies. I did not include the HTML code for mapping and data bindings, data.sql file that auto-generates data, entity table creation sql files and how to make postgres databases. 

I am working on deploying it to AWS and create docker files. 


Best resources to learn Spring Framework are Baeldung and Spring Guru <3.
